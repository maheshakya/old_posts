Though I'm a Python fanatic, Jekyll is inconceivably awesome! (It's Ruby)

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
    print "Hi, " name

print_hi('Gonaa')
#=> prints 'Hi, Gonaa' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
